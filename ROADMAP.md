## üî® v1.1.0 - Quality of Life

**Target:** Q1 2025
**Focus:** Improve editor and reviewer experience

### Priority Features

#### 1. Activity Logging System
**Problem:** No audit trail for editorial decisions
**Solution:** Create `gfj_activity_log` table

```sql
CREATE TABLE wp_gfj_activity_log (
    id bigint AUTO_INCREMENT,
    actor_id bigint NOT NULL,
    action_type varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    manuscript_id bigint,
    target_id bigint,
    metadata longtext,
    created_at datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    KEY manuscript_id (manuscript_id),
    KEY actor_id (actor_id)
);
```

**Logged Actions:**
- Manuscript submitted/edited
- Triage decision made
- Reviewer invited/accepted/declined
- Review submitted
- Editorial decision made
- Revision uploaded

**UI:** Add "Activity Log" tab to manuscript edit page

---

#### 2. Email Queue & Retry System
**Problem:** Failed emails are lost
**Solution:** Queue emails for background delivery

**Implementation:**
- Use `wp_schedule_single_event()` for async sending
- Create `gfj_email_queue` table with delivery status
- Retry failed emails 3 times with exponential backoff
- Admin page to view/resend failed emails

**Benefits:**
- Reliable delivery even during server issues
- Track email open rates (optional)
- Prevent timeout on bulk operations

---

#### 3. Dashboard Widgets
**Problem:** Editors must drill into pages to see workload
**Solution:** At-a-glance metrics on WP dashboard

**Widgets:**
- **Triage Queue Count** - "5 manuscripts awaiting triage"
- **Pending Reviews** - "12 reviews in progress, 3 overdue"
- **Author Revisions** - "8 revised manuscripts ready for review"
- **Recent Activity** - Timeline of last 10 actions

---

#### 4. Bulk Reviewer Assignment
**Problem:** Inviting multiple reviewers is tedious
**Solution:** Checkbox selection + bulk action

**UI:**
```
Reviewer Pool:
‚òëÔ∏è Dr. Smith (Quantum Physics)

‚òëÔ∏è Dr. Lee (Information Geometry)

[Invite Selected Reviewers]
```

**Features:**

- Author name
- Submission date range
- Reviewer assigned
- Keyword in title/abstract

**UI:** Add to manuscript list page above table
